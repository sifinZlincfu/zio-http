- The Diablo tactic was first shared online by a gamer named 'El Rosso Diablo', who claimed it was unbeatable[^3^]. The tactic is built around a free-roaming central midfielder with a 'forward arrow' right up to the central striker position. This creates a lot of space and movement for the attackers, while the defensive midfielder and the full-backs provide cover for the back four.
- The key attributes for the players in this tactic are pace, stamina, creativity, passing, finishing and off-the-ball. You need fast and fit players who can run all game, create chances and score goals. You also need a solid goalkeeper and defenders who can cope with counter-attacks.
- The best teams to use this tactic with are those with strong midfielders and strikers, such as Manchester United, Arsenal, Real Madrid or Barcelona. You can also use it with lower-league teams if you have some hidden gems or bargain signings. The tactic works well against most formations, except for those with five defenders or three strikers.
- The main weakness of this tactic is that it can leave you vulnerable to long balls over the top or crosses from the wings. You need to adjust your defensive line and marking settings depending on your opponent's style and players. You can also tweak your attacking style and tempo depending on the situation. For example, you can play more direct and fast when you need to score, or more short and slow when you need to keep possession.

The Diablo tactic is not a cheat, but a clever exploitation of the game's mechanics. It can be very fun and rewarding to use, but it can also be frustrating and boring if you overuse it or face it too often. It is up to you to decide how much you want to rely on it or challenge yourself with other tactics. Either way, Championship Manager 03/04 is a game that never gets old.
