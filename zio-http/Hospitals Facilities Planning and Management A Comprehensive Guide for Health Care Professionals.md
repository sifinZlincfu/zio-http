## The steps and stages of hospitals facilities planning and management
 
Hospitals facilities planning and management is a dynamic and continuous process that requires collaboration among various stakeholders such as hospital administrators, clinicians, architects, engineers, consultants, contractors, regulators, suppliers, patients and communities. Hospitals facilities planning and management can be divided into four main stages: strategic planning, design development, construction implementation and operation maintenance.
  
### Strategic planning
 
Strategic planning is the first stage of hospitals facilities planning and management. It involves defining the vision, mission, goals and objectives of the hospital organization; assessing the current situation and future trends of the healthcare market; identifying the needs and expectations of the target population; conducting a feasibility study to evaluate the technical, financial, legal and social aspects of the project; developing a master plan to outline the scope, schedule, budget and quality standards of the project; forming a project team to oversee the project execution; securing the necessary approvals, permits and funding for the project.
  
### Design development
 
Design development is the second stage of hospitals facilities planning and management. It involves translating the strategic plan into a detailed design that meets the functional, aesthetic, environmental and regulatory requirements of the project; selecting the appropriate site, layout, structure, materials, systems, equipment and technology for the project; preparing the architectural drawings, engineering specifications, cost estimates and tender documents for the project; engaging with potential contractors, suppliers and vendors to solicit bids and negotiate contracts for the project.
  
### Construction implementation
 
Construction implementation is the third stage of hospitals facilities planning and management. It involves overseeing the actual construction of the project according to the design specifications; monitoring the progress, quality, safety and cost of the project; managing the changes, risks, issues and conflicts that may arise during the project; coordinating with various parties such as contractors, suppliers, vendors, regulators, inspectors and users to ensure smooth delivery of the project; conducting testing, commissioning and handover of the project.
