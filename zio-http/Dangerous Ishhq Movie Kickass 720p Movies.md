Dangerous Ishhq received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film was praised for its concept and visuals, but criticized for its execution, script, dialogues and performances. The film was also a commercial failure at the box office, earning only Rs. 5.68 crore in its first week of release.
 
The film was nominated for four awards at the 2013 Stardust Awards, including Best Actress for Karisma Kapoor, Best Director for Vikram Bhatt, Best Thriller/Action Film and Best 3D Film. However, it did not win any of them. The film also received negative reviews from some international critics, who found it too silly and ham-fisted.
 
Dangerous Ishhq is a film that tries to be different and ambitious, but fails to deliver on its promise. It is a film that might appeal to some fans of Karisma Kapoor or Vikram Bhatt, but not to many others. It is a film that could have been much better, if only it had a stronger script, better direction and more convincing performances.
  
Dangerous Ishhq was Karisma Kapoor's comeback film after a hiatus of nine years. She had last appeared in the 2003 film Mere Jeevan Saathi. The film was also her first 3D film and her first film with director Vikram Bhatt. She underwent a rigorous training for six months to prepare for her role and performed her own stunts in the film.
 
The film was shot in various locations across India, including Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Delhi and Mumbai. The film also used extensive visual effects and computer graphics to recreate the historical settings and scenes. The film had a budget of Rs. 30 crore and was released in around 1,000 screens worldwide.
