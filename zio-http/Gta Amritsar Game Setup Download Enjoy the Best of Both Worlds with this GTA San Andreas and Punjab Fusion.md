However, Ra.One escapes from the game into the real world and pursues Prateek and his mother Sonia (Kapoor), who have the only device that can control him. Shekhar's digital avatar G.One (also Khan) comes to their rescue and battles Ra.One to save them.

Ra.One was a highly ambitious project for Shah Rukh Khan, who wanted to make a movie that would appeal to both children and adults. He also wanted to showcase the potential of Indian cinema in the genre of science fiction and superhero movies. He came up with the idea of Ra.One after watching his son play video games and being fascinated by the concept of virtual reality[^1^]. He also drew inspiration from movies like The Terminator, Spider-Man and The Matrix[^1^].
 
Khan collaborated with director Anubhav Sinha, who had previously made movies like Tum Bin and Dus. Sinha co-wrote the screenplay with Kanika Dhillon, Mushtaq Sheikh and Niranjan Iyengar. The movie also featured dialogues by David Benullo, who had written Hollywood movies like Hallowed Ground and Around the World in 80 Days[^2^]. The movie had a large ensemble cast of actors from India and abroad, including Rajinikanth, who made a special appearance as his character Chitti from the movie Enthiran[^2^].
 
The movie was shot in various locations across India, UK and USA. The movie required extensive use of visual effects, which were done by several studios such as Red Chillies VFX, Prime Focus, Digital Domain and EyeQube. The movie also featured elaborate action sequences choreographed by Andy Gill, Spiro Razatos and Parvez Khan.
