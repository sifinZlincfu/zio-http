## Installation and Configuration
 
The installation process of this scenery is very simple and straightforward. You just need to download the installer file from the website where you purchased it, run it, and follow the instructions on the screen. The installer will automatically detect your FSX folder and install the scenery files there. You can also choose to install some optional features, such as static aircraft, AI traffic, or high-resolution textures.
 
After the installation is complete, you can launch FSX and select Cancun International Airport (MMUN) from the airport menu. The scenery will load automatically and you will be ready to fly. There is no need to configure any settings or adjust any sliders in FSX. The scenery is designed to work well with the default settings and other add-ons.
 
## Performance
 
One of the main concerns when installing a new scenery add-on is how it will affect the performance and frame rate of FSX. Fortunately, Aviation Multimedia Studios' Cancun 2012 (MMUN) scenery is very well optimized and does not have a significant impact on the system resources. We tested the scenery on a mid-range PC with the following specifications:

- CPU: Intel Core i5-9400F @ 2.9 GHz
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6 GB
- RAM: 16 GB DDR4
- OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit
- FSX: Acceleration Pack with SP2

We used the default FSX settings for graphics and display, except for setting the resolution to 1920x1080 and enabling anti-aliasing. We also used some other add-ons for weather (Active Sky Next), aircraft (PMDG 737 NGX), and traffic (Ultimate Traffic 2). We flew a short flight from Cancun to Cozumel in different weather conditions and times of day.
 
We found that the scenery ran smoothly and without any stuttering or lagging. The frame rate was stable and averaged around 30 FPS, which is acceptable for FSX standards. The scenery did not cause any crashes or errors during our test flights. We were impressed by how well this scenery performed on our system, considering the level of detail and quality it offers.
 
## Quality
 
The quality of this scenery is also very high and realistic. The airport looks exactly like the real one, with accurate runway and taxiway layout, markings, signs, buildings, objects, vehicles, jetways, etc. The ground textures are photo-realistic and blend well with the surrounding terrain. The 3D objects are detailed and have high-resolution textures
