The Basketball Diaries is a 1995 film based on the autobiographical book by Jim Carroll, a former basketball star who became addicted to heroin in his teenage years. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jim, who narrates his descent into the dark world of drugs, crime and prostitution through his diary entries. The film also features Mark Wahlberg, Juliette Lewis and Lorraine Bracco as Jim's friends and family.
 
The film is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the effects of drug addiction on a young person's life, as well as the challenges of overcoming it.

The film does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of drug abuse, such as withdrawal symptoms, overdose, HIV infection and sexual assault.
