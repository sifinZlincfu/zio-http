## What is a Highly Compressed File?
 
A highly compressed file is a file that has been reduced in size by using a compression algorithm. Compression algorithms remove redundant or unnecessary data from a file and store it in a more efficient way. This way, the file size can be significantly reduced without losing much quality or information. Highly compressed files are useful for saving disk space and bandwidth, as well as for faster downloading and uploading.
