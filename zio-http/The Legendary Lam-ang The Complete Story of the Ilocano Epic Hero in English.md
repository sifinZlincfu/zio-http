## Summary of the Epic
  
The epic begins with the birth of Lam-ang, who was conceived by his parents Don Juan and Namongan while they were eating various fruits and animals. Lam-ang was able to speak as soon as he was born, and he asked his mother to name him Lam-ang and to have him baptized by old man Guibuan. He also asked about his father, who had gone to fight the Igorot tribe in the mountains.
  
Lam-ang decided to follow his father's footsteps and seek revenge for his death. He left his mother and went to the land of the Igorot, where he encountered many enemies and dangers. He used his wit and strength to overcome them all, and he single-handedly killed all the Igorot warriors. He then returned to his mother with his father's severed head as a trophy.
  
On his way home, he met a woman named Ines Kannoyan, who was the daughter of a wealthy nobleman. He fell in love with her at first sight, and he vowed to win her heart. He asked his mother's permission to court her, and he prepared many gifts and offerings for her family. He also brought along his magical rooster and dog, who helped him impress Ines and her parents.
  
Ines accepted Lam-ang's proposal, and they agreed to get married. However, before the wedding, Lam-ang had to perform a ritual bath in the river as a sign of respect for Ines' ancestors. He went to the river with his rooster and dog, but he was attacked by a giant shark called Berkakan. The shark swallowed him whole, leaving only his bones behind.
  
His rooster and dog mourned for him, and they used their powers to bring him back to life. They gathered his bones and placed them inside a jar. Then they crowed and barked loudly, causing an earthquake that shook the jar and restored Lam-ang's flesh and blood. Lam-ang emerged from the jar alive and well, much to the joy of Ines and her family.
  
Lam-ang and Ines finally got married in a lavish ceremony that lasted for several days. They invited many guests from different tribes and regions, who brought gifts and tributes for them. They also performed dances and songs that showcased their skills and talents. After the wedding, they settled in Nalbuan, where they lived happily ever after.
