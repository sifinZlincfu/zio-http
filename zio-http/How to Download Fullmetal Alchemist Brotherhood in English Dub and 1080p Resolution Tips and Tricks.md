If you are wondering why there are two anime series based on the same manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a sequel or a remake of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime. The original anime, which aired from 2003 to 2004, deviated from the manga storyline halfway through and created its own ending. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which aired from 2009 to 2010, followed the manga more faithfully and adapted the entire story. Both anime have their own merits and flaws, but many fans agree that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is more faithful to the author's vision and has a more satisfying conclusion.
 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not only a thrilling adventure, but also a profound exploration of themes such as human nature, morality, sacrifice, family, and redemption. The series does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war, genocide, corruption, and human experimentation, but also showcases the power of friendship, love, hope, and courage. The series also features a diverse and memorable cast of characters, each with their own personality, backstory, and development. Some of the fan-favorites include Roy Mustang, the charismatic and ambitious Flame Alchemist; Riza Hawkeye, his loyal and sharpshooting lieutenant; Winry Rockbell, the cheerful and talented automail mechanic; Ling Yao, the greedy and cunning prince of Xing; and Greed, the rebellious and charismatic Homunculus.
