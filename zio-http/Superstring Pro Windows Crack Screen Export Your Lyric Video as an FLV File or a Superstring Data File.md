# How to Fix a Cracked Screen on Superstring Pro Windows
 
Superstring Pro Windows is a powerful application that lets you create stunning lyric videos in minutes. However, if you accidentally crack your screen while using it, you may wonder how to fix it without losing your data or compromising your video quality. Here are some tips on how to repair a cracked screen on Superstring Pro Windows.
 
- First, back up your data. You can use an external hard drive, a cloud service, or a USB flash drive to save your files and projects. This way, you can restore them later if you need to replace your screen or reinstall Superstring Pro Windows.
- Second, check your warranty. If your screen is cracked due to a manufacturing defect or a covered accident, you may be eligible for a free or discounted repair from the manufacturer or the retailer. Contact them and see if they can help you with the issue.
- Third, find a reputable repair service. If your warranty does not cover the damage or has expired, you can look for a local or online repair service that specializes in fixing cracked screens. Make sure they have good reviews, reasonable prices, and fast turnaround times. You can also ask them if they can preserve your data and settings while repairing your screen.
- Fourth, follow the instructions. Once you have chosen a repair service, follow their instructions on how to send or bring your device to them. Pack it securely and include any relevant information, such as your contact details, your device model, and your problem description. Keep the tracking number or receipt for reference.
- Fifth, wait for the repair. Depending on the severity of the damage and the availability of the parts, the repair may take from a few hours to a few days. You can check the status of your repair online or by calling the service provider. Once the repair is done, you will receive a confirmation email or phone call.
- Sixth, test your device. After you get your device back, test it thoroughly to make sure everything works properly. Check the screen quality, the touch sensitivity, the sound, the camera, and the battery life. If you notice any problems or defects, contact the repair service immediately and ask for a refund or a redo.

By following these steps, you can fix a cracked screen on Superstring Pro Windows and enjoy creating lyric videos again. However, to prevent this from happening again, you should also take some precautions, such as using a screen protector, a case, and a padded bag for your device. You should also avoid dropping it, exposing it to extreme temperatures or moisture, or placing it near magnets or sharp objects.
