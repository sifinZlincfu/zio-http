The Breviarium Monasticum has a long and rich history, dating back to the 6th century, when St. Benedict of Nursia wrote his Rule for his monastic communities. The Rule contains detailed instructions on how to pray the psalms and other biblical texts throughout the day and night, in what is known as the Divine Office or the Liturgy of the Hours. The Breviarium Monasticum is the collection of these texts, arranged according to the seasons, feasts, and hours of the liturgical year.
 
The Breviarium Monasticum has been revised and updated several times over the centuries, to reflect the changes in the Church and the world. The most recent edition was published in 1963, after the Second Vatican Council, which called for a renewal and adaptation of the liturgy. The 1963 edition follows the general structure and content of the previous editions, but also incorporates some reforms and simplifications, such as reducing the number of psalms per hour, adding more readings from Scripture and the Fathers of the Church, and allowing more flexibility and diversity in the choice of texts.
