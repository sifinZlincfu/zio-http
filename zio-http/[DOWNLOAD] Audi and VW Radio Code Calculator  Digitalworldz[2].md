# How to Unlock Your Audi Radio Code with AUZ1Z1 120
 
If you have an Audi car with a radio that displays "SAFE" on the screen, you need to enter a code to unlock it. The code is usually found on a label attached to the radio box, which you can access by partially pulling out the unit from the centre of the console. The code always begins with the letters AUZ, followed by a series of numbers. For example: AUZ1Z1 120.
 
However, if you have lost or misplaced your code, don't worry. You can still get it online using an Audi radio code generator. This is a simple and fast way to retrieve your pin code in minutes. All you need is the serial number of your radio, which you can find on the label or on the screen of your unit.

## Steps to Enter Your Audi Radio Code
 
The procedure to enter your code may vary depending on the model and type of your radio. Here are some common methods for different Audi radios:

- To enter the code, use buttons 1 to 4. For example, if the first digit of your code is a 5, press the button 1 for five times. Do the same with the other three digits of your Audi radio code.
- Press the Enter button to confirm the safe code.

### Concert Safe Code Entry

- Turn your radio on and ensure it reads SAFE.
- Simultaneously press and hold the buttons FM 2 and RDS until you see "1000" on screen.
- Use the preset buttons 1 - 4 to enter the code. Example: If your first digit is a 3, press button 1 for three times. Do the same with the remaining three digits of the code.
- Submit the code holding the buttons FM 2 and RDS until 'SAFE' is displayed.
- The radio should start working.

### Chorus Blaupunkt CD Code Entry

- To enter the code, repeatedly press button 1 until the first digit is entered. Do the same with button 2, 3 and 4.
- Hit the "Enter" button to submit the code.
