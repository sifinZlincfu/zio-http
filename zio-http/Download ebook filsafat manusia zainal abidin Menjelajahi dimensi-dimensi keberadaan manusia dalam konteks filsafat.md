## Human Nature and Reason
  
One of the fundamental questions that philosophy tries to answer is: what is human nature? What makes us human and different from other animals or beings? One of the common answers that many philosophers give is: reason. Reason is the ability to think logically, rationally, and objectively. Reason is what enables us to acquire knowledge, to solve problems, to communicate, and to create art and science.
  
However, reason is not always seen as a positive or desirable trait of human nature. Some philosophers argue that reason can also lead to errors, illusions, prejudices, and conflicts. Reason can also be corrupted by passions, emotions, desires, and interests. Reason can also be limited by our senses, language, culture, and history.
  
In ebook filsafat manusia zainal abidin, you will learn how different philosophers view the role and value of reason in human nature. You will also learn how they try to balance reason with other aspects of human nature, such as emotion, intuition, faith, and imagination.
  
## Human Nature and Emotion
  
Another important aspect of human nature is emotion. Emotion is the ability to feel and express various feelings, such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, hate, etc. Emotion is what makes us alive and sensitive to ourselves and others. Emotion is what motivates us to act and react in certain ways.
  
However, emotion is not always seen as a positive or desirable trait of human nature. Some philosophers argue that emotion can also be irrational, chaotic, destructive, and harmful. Emotion can also interfere with reason, judgment, morality, and happiness. Emotion can also be manipulated by external factors, such as society, media, propaganda, etc.
  
In ebook filsafat manusia zainal abidin, you will learn how different philosophers view the role and value of emotion in human nature. You will also learn how they try to balance emotion with other aspects of human nature, such as reason, will, duty, and virtue.
